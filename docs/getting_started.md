# Project Setup

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Node.js 16.x or higher
- npm, yarn, or pnpm package manager
- A modern code editor (VS Code recommended)

## Creating Your First Project

### 1. Sign Up and Create Project

1. Visit [cocobase.buzz](https://cocobase.buzz) and create your account
2. Click "Create New Project" in your dashboard
3. Choose your project name and region

### 2. Installation

Install the Cocobase SDK in your project:

```bash
# Using npm

# Using yarn
yarn add cocobase

# Using pnpm
pnpm add cocobase
```

### 3. Basic Configuration

Create a new file to initialize Cocobase:

```typescript
// lib/cocobase.ts
import { Cocobase } from "cocobase";

const db = new Cocobase({
  apiKey: process.env.COCOBASE_API_KEY, // Your API key
});

export default db;
```

### 4. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```env
COCOBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
COCOBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
```
